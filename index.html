                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>Hi, I'm David Ramroop, an aspiring Cloud Engineer. I am currently learning about cloud computing and
                    working on projects to build my skills. I am also studying for certifications to validate my
                    knowledge
                    and experience. I am excited to learn more about cloud computing and to work on projects that will
                    help
                    me
                    grow as a Cloud Engineer.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>I have over 8 years of experience in the ICT industry with a strong background in software, hardware, and
                networking. Throughout my career, I have configured, administered, and provided technical support for
                various network infrastructures and databases. I have worked with both local and virtual network
                environments and I acquired skills in Active Directory, Azure AD, DNS servers, file servers, Hyper-V,
                and Linux-based platforms.

                I also have technical expertise in Office 365 administration, having managed a forest for three years
                and successfully integrated Azure AD for credential synchronization between cloud and on-prem resources.
                Additionally, I have experience maintaining 24/7 critical systems, providing customer support, and
                ensuring seamless ICT operations.

                Over the last two years, I have been pursuing a degree in Computer Application and Cloud Computing,
                which has deepened my passion for cloud infrastructure. I have been actively exploring Amazon Web
                Services and working on various cloud projects to gain hands-on experience. One of my main goals is to
                document and share step-by-step procedures from my projects while tackling real-world technical
                challenges.

                As I progress, my goal is to actively contribute to the field of Cloud Engineering, leveraging my
                technical expertise to empower business innovation and growth. I am excited about the opportunities that
                cloud computing offers and look forward to collaborating, learning and making an impact in the industry.
